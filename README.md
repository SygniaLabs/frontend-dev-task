# React ToDo App Development Task

Hello and welcome!

We are excited to present you with a task where you'll be developing a ToDo application using React. This task is designed to test your React skills, attention to detail, and ability to work with external APIs. Don't worry, we've got all the assets and instructions you need!

## The Task

Your task is to create a ToDo app that interacts with an already provided ToDo API. The application should display the tasks in a table as shown in the screenshot provided. The main screen of the app should be designed to match the screenshot. 
You will be using React for this task, and we expect you to leverage best practices for state management, component structure, and other aspects of a modern React application.

## Design

To help you with the design, we have provided a screenshot of the application, a link to the Google font used in the app, and a Figma file. The Figma file should provide you with more granular details about the app's design.

- Google Font - [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito)
- Figma Design - [ToDo App Design](https://www.figma.com/file/bWThNKVhrueQ2T6Av8Erh8/To-do-list?node-id=0%3A1&t=J5sGg96ADAltbOFc-1)
- Screenshots of the app

## What we're looking for

- Clean, modular, and maintainable code
- Clear state management
- Accurate implementation of the design
- Correct usage of the provided API

## Instructions

We've created a React app using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for you, and have a very basic implementation that is full of bugs ðŸ˜…
Your goal is to dive into the code, and follow the below steps. Try to complete as many steps as you can:

  1. Add sorting to the table - the table should be sorted by "Created At" ascending by default.
  2. Make the priority dropdown work - currently the priority doesn't change when selecting a new one.
  3. Change the radio buttons next to the todo items to checkboxes. When a task is selected, it should be marked with a strikethrough (i.e. completed).
  4. Add the top bar - tasks summary legend and avatar.
  5. Add a toggle to allow filtering by Incomplete / All.
  6. Add the "Add todo" wizard.
  7. Make everything work against the API.
  8. *Bonus*: make the table look as closely as you can to the design in the screenshots and Figma.

We know that this is a short time frame to get everything done, so please advance in the steps according to this order.

Your application should be able to run locally using the `npm install` and `npm run dev` commands.

Feel free to use your favorite packages or assistance via ChatGPT.

Please note that the task is time-bound and should be completed within 2 hours.

## Submission

Once you've finished, please follow these steps to submit your work:

1. Ensure all of your code is committed to your local Git repository.
2. Zip your entire project directory, or push your code to a GitHub repository.
3. Use [this form](https://forms.monday.com/forms/6ef7a9dd1dfa409814ecec052fcb7ad0?r=use1) to upload your solution.

Please make sure you submit your solution within the time frame.

## Few words

Remember, this is not just about getting the task done; we want to see your problem-solving skills, creativity, and attention to detail. Good luck, and most importantly, have fun! 

We are looking forward to reviewing your solution!
